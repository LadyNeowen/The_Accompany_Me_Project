# Welcome to Accompany Me!

Accompany me is a website for both pet owners to find a daycare person to give their pets company and a more personalized experience than the kennels out there, 
and also for elderly people who feel they would love to have the company of a pet but who don't have the energy or time to take care of say pet full time.
The elderly people who are interested in this, volunteer for the job without any expectations to pay for animal food, take walks or pay for any insurance for the pets.

The pet owner alone stands for the cost of the day care, which essentially goes as payment to the courier for picking up and delivering the pet to and from it's home location or set appointed place of pickup.
The pet owner also holds responsebility to for example walk the dog beforehand and send with them any animal food that they want their daycare-person to give to their pet.

At the home page you will find initial information about how the business works, there is a gallery where you can see different pets who are currently in the market of finding their daycare person, as well as some of the pairs that already been made through our website.

At the signup page you can file your first name, last name, email address and what service you are intested in with Accompany me.
There you can write your personal preference, what kind of pet you are interested in giving company to, what kind of person you are and what you are looking for when coming to us, again this goes both ways for either pet owners or people who are interested in volunteering for daycare.

We then will send you additional information and take the first steps to finding you the match you are looking for. 

Under contacts, you will also find our telephone number, as well as our email, should you want to speak to us about any questions you might have about us, about the process or general information about our business.

Our goal is to make you feel at ease with your collaboration with us, and such our website is made to fit for those who are generally not advanced in computer technology, with an easy navigation and just the right amount of information at the get go for an easier understanding of the process and what our company is about.

We thank you for reading this and hope you have a nice tour of Accompany Me!

# The stategy!

* As mentioned above the site is created for eyes who have seen much. 
Thus the icons are bigger, the information is in different colored boxes with light backrounds for an easy read, 
and made with big font-sizes.
* The website is also made to fit very large screens since one of our main target users are people who
 most likely are inclined to have big screens on their computers and perhaps not so keen on using smartphones.
So the website is made for a big range of screen sizes to fit our need for our general audience.

# Design

## Colours

* The colours are light and earthy to make the user calm. 
* The header is a soothing turqois that goes well with the colours of the hero image below.
* The colours of the dog in the hero image are used as a red thread throughout the page with a similiar colour scheme.
* Finally the signup page does the same but with the colours a bit darker and toned down, using the signup hero image's colours to further soothe the user and then link those colours with the submit button.
* I mainly used these hex colours for my page.
* ![Hex Colours](assets/images/Hex_colours.png "Hex colours")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Fonts

* I am using Merriweather, sans serif throughout the entire page for consistency, the font is soft and appealing to the users eye.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Testing

* Upon arrival the user quickly sees the menu navigation bars and can easely find their way around the page.

* Google Chrome developer tool to find any remaining errors.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bugs and fixes

* Noticed I had issues with my submit button not working properly so I went to this website to get the information right.
 https://www.jotform.com/help/118-how-to-customize-the-submit-button-with-css/
* Issues with my footer bar shifting to the left, asked for help on slack and got help from Ronan McGill who pointed out it might be because of my letter-spacing,
changing this to only apply for id's made for first and second icon (.fb, .tw) fixed the issue.
* Ran into some other trouble with my margin and padding throughout the page, got help from my friend Tyler Risinger who then helped me apply at top of my style.css and explained why. 
*{
    margin:0;
    padding:0;
}

* Trouble with my twitter icon not being clickable due to padding top from the Copyright div, my friend Tyler Risinger helped me by showing me that adding 
pointer-events:none; to my copyright ID, helped fix the issue.

* Had issue with media screen sizes from 547px wide and down.
Was not able to change size or do any other changes that prevented the page from crashing at this size.
Tyler Risinger then showed me that by doing this entry to the header would fix the problem and allow my screen to scale down without crashing.
    #head {
        flex-flow: column;
        height: 130px;
    }
* Ran the The W3C CSS Validation service and The W3C Markup Validation service for all 3 pages and found errors due to spacing in two of the image names, changing the spaces to a underline fixed the problem.

# Deployment 

* Site will be deployed to Github Pages

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Credits

* First I would like to thank my new study buddy and very good friend Laura Taipale who's words of encouragement has helped me get through doing this while undergoing a pretty difficult time in my life. 
She motivates me, helps me with tips and has helped me by sharing some of her work and her own ways of fixing and building her code.
Thank you for finding me and for always having the right words to say, both in and out of school. 

* Overall I have recived a great deal of guidance and help from my good friend Tyler Risinger. 
He has been somewhat of a mentor for me, someone I could ask for directions and help when I did not understand why some things did not work the way I wanted.
He helped me by showing me, while explaining why he did what he did and what the changes would result in. 
I believe I have learned many things from him during this time and I am very grateful to him.

* I would also like to thank Ethan Pitt from the slack community, his help with the submit form kept me from pulling my own hair out.
He even called me from work and helped to guide me through what was one of my worst days. 
"Go grab a cup of coffee, step away from this for a while and i'll call you when I get to work." He said.
If it had not been for him that day I dont know what I would have done! 
So thank you Ethan for your kindness and eagerness to help.

* I would also like to thank Ronan McGill who helped me see the flaw in my design which after what could have been hours trying to figure out what was wrong, made the letters in my code do the mumbo jumbo. 

You guys are the best, thank you! <3
